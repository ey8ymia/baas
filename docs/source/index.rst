BaaS User Guide
===============

BaaS (Backup as a Service) is a service provided to Synnefo cloud users in
order to backup their data to `Pithos`_ Storage. It supports encrypted,
incremental backups in a space and bandwidth-efficient way through a
user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).


BaaS uses `Duplicity`_ as the backend.

BaaS is implemented and supported by the `Synnefo Development Team`_ of the
`Greek Research and Technology Network`_ and is an open source project,
licensed under GPL v3.
